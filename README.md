Digital Music Store Analysis (MySQL)

Objective : I've been diving into a Digital Music Store Analysis using MySQL. In this project, I'm exploring 11 different tables with a straightforward aim of helping the store figure out how to grow its business by tackling specific Problems.

Key Highlights:

- CTEs : I've used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to make the queries run faster and make the code easier to understand.

- Window Functions : I've used window functions like Dense_rank and row_number. These functions help organize and rank data.

-Subqueries : I've used Subqueries with Where Clauses to efficiently filter and extract specific information.Additionally, I've employed Subqueries with From Clauses to handle various queries.
